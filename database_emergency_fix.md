# Emergency Database Schema Fix

You're still encountering the "Database error querying schema" issue. Let's take a more aggressive approach to fix it.

## Step 1: Apply the Emergency SQL Fix

1. Login to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to the "SQL Editor" section in the left sidebar
4. Create a new query
5. Copy the ENTIRE contents of `supabase/migrations/schema_emergency_fix.sql` and paste it into the SQL editor
6. Click "Run" to execute the SQL script
7. Wait for the script to complete (this may take a few seconds)

## Step 2: Update App.tsx

Replace your `checkUser` function in `src/App.tsx` with the new version we've provided. This new version:

- Tries multiple approaches to get profile data
- Has a better fallback mechanism
- Can even create a profile if none exists
- Handles schema errors more gracefully

## Step 3: Test the Fix

1. Restart your development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Clear your browser cache and cookies
3. Try logging in with existing accounts
4. If you encounter errors, check the browser console (F12) for specific error messages

## What This Emergency Fix Does

This more aggressive fix:

1. Creates a view (`user_profiles_complete`) that combines data from auth.users and profiles
2. Adds a function (`get_user_profile`) to retrieve complete user data
3. Makes App.tsx try multiple approaches to find user data
4. Adds a last-resort profile creation if no profile exists
5. Fixes NULL values in critical fields
6. Directly analyzes tables to refresh schema cache

## If Problems Persist

If you still experience issues:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Try logging in with a completely new account
3. Consider dropping and recreating the entire profiles table
4. Check the Supabase logs for any errors related to database functions or queries
